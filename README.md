##### How do I approach designing software?
 When it comes to designing software that doesn't have a very tight timeline, I typically work out the structure of the program prior to putting anything down on paper. I work through all the algorithms needed and ensure I understand how it will work together in the end. I try to build the software modular so I can reuse sections of code if needed and I try my best to keep it simple and use existing standard libraries if they exist to keep the code as efficient as possible. Unfortunately with this project, I was under a time crunch pretty much from start to finish, so I didn't get a chance to implement any of that here. 

##### How do I approach developing programs?
 Similarly to what I said previously, I tend to try to build my code as modular as possible, with various methods of accessing functions to reuse large segments of code. I also try to organize it as best as I can by creating various folders that organize the code by purpose, and including folders for assets like textures as well. Iteration definitely affected my development as we were typically building on the codebase of previous assignments and refactoring was absolutely neseccesary to have the code running as needed, especially transitioning from one type of mesh to another. 
 
##### How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
  This class gave me new knowledge in relation to my problem solving skills with code, as well as further helped me solidify my undertanding of the software development life cycle. This class absolutely transfered skills that will be applied in my future professional pathway in the form of improvements towards my method of coding.
